I am a PhD candidate in the School of Engineering & Applied Science at Yale University. My thesis committee is composed of Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio (advisor), Aaron Dollar, Ian Abraham, and Brian Scassellati. My research is focused on novel robotic systems and their control in unstructured environments, especially in the amphibious environment. 

Previously, I worked at a warehouse robotics startup that tackles the key piece of warehouse automation -- container unloading and designed their patent-pending mechanism that allows for a throughput of 1000 boxes per hour. I also wrote the embedded code for the mobile base which allows for omnidirectional motion both inside the container and around the warehouse. 

I also worked at Meta Reality Labs in Redmond, WA as a research scientist intern.
